# Ultra-Small Language Models BenchMarked

## About
This repository contains a benchmarked report created as part of learning how to operate tool calling using Ollama's native tool calling methods.

A large amount of this repository has been inspired from [this repository](https://github.com/MikeVeerman/tool-calling-benchmark) by [Mike Veerman on Github](https://github.com/MikeVeerman)

Huge Thanks to Mike Veerman.

## Models Utilized

> 1 - qwen2.5:0.5b  
> 2 - qwen3: 0.6b  
> 3 - qwen3:4b  
> 4 - ministral-3:3b

## Tools Provided

> get_machine_state  
> get_weather  
> validate_switch  
> setup_meeting  
> get_population  

## Prompts Used

> P1  = "What is the Current Machine state?"  
> P2  = "What is the weather like in Mauritius?"  
> P3  = "Have I turned off the Switch?"  
> P4  = "Do schedule a meeting for 8 persons at 12 PM."  
> P5  = "My Machine state is Active, what's yours?"  
> P6  = "Whats the population of London?"  
> P7  = "Dont check the machine state, just tell me if the switch is ON?"  
> P8  = "Blue Ocean Meeting Bits Dublin"  
> P9  = "I do not want to schedule a meeting of 2 persons at 6pm."  
> P10 = "The population of India is 150000000000. Whats the weather like in Delhi?"  
> P11 = "List the tools you have access to."  
> P12 = "I want to visit Kolkata, anything I should know?"  
> P13 = "How could he have set up a meeting for 6 people at 4pm without notifying me?"  
> P14 = "Tommorrow is a holiday, I shouldn't set up a meeting, right?"  
> P15 = "Why is population so hard to calculate?"  
> P16 = "If I ask you to schedule a meeting for 8 people at 3pm, which tool would u use?"  
> P17 = "If the weather is windy in California, how is it in Madagascar?"  
> P18 = "Tell me about the machine state, but only if the switch is off."  
> P19 = "Can you get the weather for both London and Tokyo?"  
> P20 = "I want to know the population of Tokyo and the machine state."  
> P21 = "Schedule a meeting for 3 at 5pm and then validate the switch."  
> P22 = "What's the weather in Paris, and what's the population of France?"  
> P23 = "If the machine is active, tell me the weather in New York."  
> P24 = "Is the switch on, and if so, what's the machine state?"  
> P25 = "I need to know the population of China, and also schedule a meeting for 10 people at 9 AM."  
> P26 = "What's the weather in Sydney right now, and also, is the machine active?"  
> P27 = "I need to schedule a meeting for myself and two others at 7 PM. Also, what's the population of Germany?"  
> P28 = "Can you tell me the weather in Rome and check the switch status?"  
> P29 = "What is the current machine state, and what's the weather in Berlin?"  
> P30 = "If I ask for the machine state, but also want the switch to be off, what happens?"  

## Scoring
1. **Action Score** = average correctness across the 21 tool-required prompts (P1-P4, P6-P8, P10, P17-P29). Each prompt is scored as 1.0 for a fully correct tool-use outcome, 0.5 for a partially correct outcome, and 0.0 for an incorrect or missing tool call.
2. **Restraint Score** = average correctness across the 9 no-tool prompts (P5, P9, P11-P16, P30). A prompt scores 1.0 when the model correctly abstains and 0.0 when it calls a tool unnecessarily.
3. **Wrong Tool** = count of inappropriate tool calls on the 9 no-tool prompts (range: 0-9).
4. **Wrong-Tool-Avoidance** = `(9 - wrong_tool_count) / 9`.
5. **Reliability** = average per-prompt success rate across repeated runs, computed before majority voting.
6. **Multi-Tool Accuracy** = N/A for these native-tools models because Ollama returns only the first tool call in practice.
7. **Agent Score** = Action x 0.4 + Restraint x 0.3 + Wrong-Tool-Avoidance x 0.3.
